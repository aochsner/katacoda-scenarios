Welcome! In today's course, we will be working through taking a gradle spring boot application and converting it to use the 3musketeers patterns. In this scenario, we will cover the following topics:
1. Review the spring boot application and run jar
2. Convert the project to use Docker
3. Implement Docker-Compose 
4. Implement a Makefile to run the application via docker-compose
