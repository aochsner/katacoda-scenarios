Test, build, and deploy your apps from anywhere, the same way. This katacoda will walk you through an introduction to the 3Musketeers practices. 3Musketeers is made up of 3 technologies. They are make, docker and docker-compose. The 3 main pillars of it are Consistency, Control and Confidence.

## Consistency
Run the same commands no matter where you are

## Control
Take control of languages, versions, and tools you need, and version source control your pipelines with your preferred VCS like GitHub and GitLab

## Confidence
Test your code and pipelines locally before your CI/CD tool runs it. Feel confident that if it works locally, it will work in your CI/CD server
